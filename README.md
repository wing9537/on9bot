# on9bot - the awesome discord robot

Some ~~useful~~ command you may use:

1. `npm install` - for downlaoding the dependencies of our project
2. `npm start` - for starting server
3. `npm test` - useless

You **MUST** create a `config.json` by yourself with the following structure.
```
{
    "clientId": "",
    "token": "",
    "publicKey": ""
}
```
